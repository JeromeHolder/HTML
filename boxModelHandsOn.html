	<h1>Exercise #1</h1>

	<p class="ex1">The actual content inside is 200px wide. The text is padded by 20px left and right, and 10px top and bottom. It has a dotted border 2px thick.</p>

	<p class="ex1">This box has the same exact CSS styles applied to it, the distance between the two boxes is 30px. Overlap between margin is a thing.</p>
